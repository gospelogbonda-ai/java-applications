//3.11 Explain what happens when a Java program attempts to divide one integer by another. What happens to the fractional part of the calculation? How can you avoid that outcome? 
When dividing two integers in Java, the fractional part is discarded — the result is an integer (truncated toward zero).
Example: 5 / 2 gives 2, not 2.5.

To avoid losing the fractional part, use floating-point division by making at least one operand a double or float.
Example: 5.0 / 2 gives 2.5.
