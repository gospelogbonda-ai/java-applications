// 4.7 Discuss a situation in which it would be more appropriate to use a do…while statement
// than a while statement. Explain why.
// Answer:
//
// The do...while statement is more appropriate when the loop body must execute at least once,
// regardless of whether the condition is true or false.
//
// Example situation:
// When displaying a menu to a user — the menu should appear at least once before asking
// if the user wants to see it again.
//
// Reason:
// In a while loop, the condition is checked first, so the loop might not run at all.
// In a do...while loop, the body executes first, and the condition is checked afterward,
// ensuring the code runs at least once.
