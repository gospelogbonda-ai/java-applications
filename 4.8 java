// 4.8 Compare and contrast the break and continue statements.
// Answer:
//
// Both break and continue are used to alter the normal flow of loops.
//
// Differences:
// - The break statement immediately terminates the entire loop and transfers control
//   to the statement that follows the loop.
//
// - The continue statement skips the remaining statements in the current iteration
//   and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.
//
// Example:
// break → exits the loop completely.
// continue → skips to the next iteration without finishing the current one.
