// (Gas Mileage)
// Drivers are concerned with the mileage their automobiles get. 
// One driver has kept track of several trips by recording the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful.
// Develop a Java application that will input the miles driven and gallons used (both as integers) for each trip. 
// The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and 
// print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all trips up to this point. 
// All averaging calculations should produce floating-point results. 
// Use class Scanner and sentinel-controlled repetition to obtain the data from the user.

import java.util.Scanner;
