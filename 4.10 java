// 4.10 What does the following program do?
//
// Answer:
// The program prints 10 rows of '@' symbols,
// with each row containing 5 '@' symbols.
//
// Explanation:
// The outer for loop (i) runs 10 times, representing the rows.
// The inner for loop (j) runs 5 times for each row, printing '@' without a newline.
// After the inner loop finishes, System.out.println() moves the cursor to the next line.
